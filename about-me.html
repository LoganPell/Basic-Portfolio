		Hi there everyone, I'm Logan, a pretty normal guy sent from Mars to examine the human species and relay my findings back to the homeworld. Don't worry, my intentions are completely harmless. I've been tasked with blending in, and assimilating to your species's customs and norms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Joking aside: I'm a Texan, city-slicker, admirer of tradition, and advocate for forward progress. In short, a bundle of oxymorons challenging the status quo as best I can. Never entering into trenchwarfare, cursing myself to create a no-man's land of interaction with my fellow men and women. Always encouraging conversation across preconceived social, economic, and political divides. 
	</p>
